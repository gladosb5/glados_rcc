so basically i dont know how 2 do readme so uhh its going to be bland
anyways this is how 2 use it:
1. open up extreme injector
2. turn ON auto inject on extreme injector
3. select your studio process and the dll
4. press inject (to make sure)
5. close it and reopen it
6. then run the 2022 INTERNAL studio (included in the github becuz im nice) with this command:
start RobloxStudioBeta.exe -localPlaceFile "C:\whatevermap"  -task StartServer -port 53640
7. now, join your super epic private server game like you can host WHATEVER you want. certain people, please use this i dont want u to infiltrate the roblox platformmm...
# ⚠ WARNING! this method disables chat filtering since roblox studio disables chat filtering (just wanted to point it out 4 people that does NOT like no no words) ⚠
